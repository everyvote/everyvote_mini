        <p>-All E<span style="color: #d90000;">V</span> software is open source (<a title="Affero General Public License version 3" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html" target="_blank">AGPLv3</a>).</p>
        <p>-All E<span style="color: #d90000;">V</span> non-software artifacts are open source (CC BY-SA).</p>
        <p>-E<span style="color: #d90000;">V</span> will seek USA non-profit status (but does not yet have non-profit status).</p>
        <p>-E<span style="color: #d90000;">V</span> will never have advertisements.</p>
        <p>-E<span style="color: #d90000;">V</span> will seek donations and grants to pay expenses.</p>
        <p>-E<span style="color: #d90000;">V</span> will be 100% financially transparent. All expenses by E<span style="color: #d90000;">V</span> must be made public information as soon as practically possible. All donors' names and the amount of their donations will be public information. If a donor makes an anonymous donation to E<span style="color: #d90000;">V</span>, the identity of the donor should remain anonymous to E<span style="color: #d90000;">V</span> as well as to the public.</p>
        <p>-In order to prevent a monopoly on #opengov tools from forming, E<span style="color: #d90000;">V</span> actively strives to make all of its software fully federation-compatible with as many other civic engagement technologies as possible. (For more information, please check out <a title="OpenGov Federation" href="http://www.everyvote.org/opengovfed/">OpenGov Federation</a>.)</p>
        <p>-E<span style="color: #d90000;">V</span> actively supports the development of free, publicly downloadable, comprehensive USA candidate and official databases, so that Americans can learn about, share their opinion, and contact <strong>all</strong> of their candidates and officials through one convenient web page.</p>
        <p>-E<span style="color: #d90000;">V</span> will never sell or share private user data with 3rd parties, unless E<span style="color: #d90000;">V</span> finds evidence a user's E<span style="color: #d90000;">V</span> account is being used to perpetuate indisputable abuse to other people, in which case E<span style="color: #d90000;">V</span> may share that user's data with US law enforcement (this definition deserves more detail and public debate).</p>
        <p>-E<span style="color: #d90000;">V</span> is an unbiased, non-partisan organization that should not declare opinions on government policy, unless the policy may interfere or assist with the successful implementation of E<span style="color: #d90000;">V</span> technology.</p>
        <p>-E<span style="color: #d90000;">V</span> can express support for the protection of self-evident, inalienable 21st century human rights for all people, including but not limited to: food, clean water, shelter, medicine, electricity, internet access, equal rights, and freedom of speech.</p>

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <p>1) Establish <strong>a reliable, comprehensive, United States candidate and official database</strong>, that anyone can freely integrate into their own website. This database would list the names and basic identifying information (like party, contact info) of all of your officially registered candidates for every election you are eligible to vote in, including federal, state, county, township, local, metropolitan water district, school district, and every other elected office that <strong><font color=#006600>American tax dollars</font></strong> support. It would also provide the names and contact information for all judges you are eligible to cast a retention vote on.</p>
        <p>2) Help create and participate in <strong>a federated opinion sharing platform (OSP) network</strong>. Today, if you vote to <span style="color: #008000;">Support </span>a bill on <a title="OpenCongress" href="http://www.opencongress.org" target="_blank">OpenCongress</a>, you need to resubmit that same vote if you later use a site like <a title="POPVOX" href="http://www.popvox.com" target="_blank">POPVOX</a>. If you declare on <a title="ISideWith" href="http://www.isidewith.com" target="_blank">ISideWith</a> that you are Pro-Life and in favor of withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, you will have to resubmit those same stances again if you later use <a title="LoveGov" href="http://www.lovegov.com" target="_blank">LoveGov</a>. It would save you time and energy if you could submit these decisions and all of your other profile information just one time, and then have the option of automatically transferring your data to any other site that tracks the same information. That's exactly what OSP federation would allow you to do. In order to make OSP federation possible, OSPs like OpenCongress, POPVOX, ISideWith, LoveGov, and the proposed Every<span style="color: #ff0000;">Vote</span>.org platform would need to agree to identical open standards, which would ensure our data is transferable and cross-compatible. (For more information on this goal, please visit the <a href="http://www.everyvote.org/opengovfed/" title="OpenGov Federation">OpenGov Federation</a> page.)</p>

        <h3>#OpenGovFed</h3>
        <p>Network federation is the ability to transfer your data from one web site over to another in a compatible format. If two websites are truly federation-compatible, then any information you submit to one site could be automatically transferred to or synced with the other. Any number of websites can be federation-compatible.</p>
        <p><strong>Only network federation can prevent social network monopolies.</strong></p>
        <p>Without true network federation, social networks will always form into monopolies. Would you rather spend hours of your time developing a profile on a social network with 500 users, or a profile on one with 500,000,000 users? Naturally we choose the 1 or 2 websites that will put us in contact with the most people, and those websites rapidly form into monopolies too big for anyone to compete with. Once we're all inside, the websites lock their doors and hold us hostage to their policies, their politics, and their advertisements.</p>
        <p>With network federation, social networks cannot form into monopolies. Say you create a profile and build a friends list on one website, but then a new website comes out that you like more. If the sites are federation-compatible, you could automatically transfer your profile and friends list to the new website. You could transfer all of your data from the old site to the new site as <em>easily</em> and <em>quickly</em> as possible. You could even sync your data on both sites, so a profile change on one site would automatically change your profile on the other, and a status update you post on one site would automatically post to the other.</p>
        <p>With network federation, none of us would be trapped into using a social network just because someone invented it before everyone else. We could use as many social networks as we want, all at the same time, and more conveniently than ever. We could experiment with and use a different social network every week, transferring all of our data each time, and never losing our data in the process.</p>
        <p>The vast majority of US #OpenGov tools are social networks, but they are social networks that no-one has a clear monopoly over ---<em>yet</em>.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Now</em></strong> ---before an #OpenGov monopoly forms--- is the best time for #OpenGov leaders and developers to collaborate and cooperate to make their tools federation-compatible, and begin participating in true network federation.. If we wait, then an #OpenGov monopoly will eventually form.</p>

        <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
        <h4>Under Construction</h4>
        <p>EveryVote's goal is to provide free civic engagement technologies as ethically as possible, and that includes no selling or sharing of private user information, unless ordered to according to under United States law. Hopefully that kind of thing would never happen though...</p>
        <p>The privacy policy is still under construction, and should be publicly debated before it is officially finished.</p>
